# Body-size-detection
The system aims to build a web application that allows users to estimate their body measures and predict their body sizes by taking a 2D picture of the body using a normal smartphone camera in one distinct direction (e.g., front view). 
<br>
To make a robust application and to train the algorithm on some real- world data, first trial was conducted in which pictures of several participants along with their body measures were taken. 
<br>
Also, the proposed approach extracts the features from pictures using computer vision and machine literacy ways to estimate the body measures (e.g., waist and bust). After that, the approach uses Mask R-CNN to estimate the appropriate size of the shoppers. Using such a system will help online shopping customers to estimate their body measures directly and ameliorate the online shopping experience ultimately.
